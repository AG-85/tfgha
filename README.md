# HOW TO

This is the simplest possible workflow to deploy to aws using terraform and gha.

Before you can use this workflow, you need to set up these GitHub Secrets:

	▪	AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
	▪	AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
To use this example:
Get an instance id:
```aiignore
aws ec2 describe-images \
    --owners amazon \
    --filters "Name=name,Values=al2023-ami-*" "Name=architecture,Values=x86_64" \
    --query "sort_by(Images, &CreationDate)[-1].ImageId" \
    --output text
```
	1.	Create a new GitHub repository
	1.	Add the files as shown above
    1.  Add this to gha yml files:
                ```
                - name: Terraform Plan
                run: terraform plan
                working-directory: terraform
                ```
	1.	Add your AWS credentials as GitHub Secrets
    1. run `aws sts get-caller-identity`
	1.	Push the code to the main branch
The workflow will:

	1.	Trigger when you push to the main branch
	2.	Initialize Terraform
	3.	Check the formatting
	4.	Create a plan
	5.	Apply the infrastructure changes

# IMPORTANT
To destroy the infrastructure when deploying manually (not via action), run terraform destroy locally.

Steps to be defined later in a video. now works remote and autodeletes

CARE WHERE YOU PUT SECRETS - MUST BE IN GitHub REPO settings (not env)

eg: https://github.com/proquickly/<your-repo-name>/settings/secrets/actions

get your aws keys from your account:
https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=<your-region>#/users/details/<your-user-name>?section=permissions


this now runs locally - updated aws config
